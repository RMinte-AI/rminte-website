## pillars

### title

Configuration-driven hardware

### text

JSON configuration defines pins, services, and system behavior. That means fewer code changes during on-site setup and a clear record of how the device is configured.

### title

North-south device control

### text

Northbound control manages inference compute; southbound control manages general-purpose compute and storage. TianshanOS links both sides and coordinates the internal devices, with each module serving its role.

### title

Secure config packs

### text

Delivering models, keys, and site parameters calls for a clear security boundary. Config packs support ECDH, AES-256-GCM, and ECDSA signatures, providing encryption and signatures for delivery.

### title

OTA and automation

### text

Update your device through HTTPS or an SD card, with automatic rollback if an update fails. Manage it through WebUI, CLI, or API. The rule engine handles repeat operations, reducing manual work in day-to-day maintenance.

## modules

### name

Agent and application module

### spec

x86 / 8 cores, 8 threads / 16GB–32GB ECC / 512GB–2TB NVMe

### text

A separate x86 computer provides dedicated resources for agents and applications. It handles tool calls, code execution, and database access, while the inference module runs the models. Broad compatibility with the x86 software ecosystem makes it easier to bring existing tools and business applications into agent workflows.

### name

Inference module

### spec

64GB VRAM / 128GB VRAM / 275 TOPS INT8 / 1200–2070 TFLOPS FP4

### text

Our inference engine and high-speed interconnect improve inference efficiency. Resources focus on model inference and KV Cache, making room for larger models, longer contexts, and higher concurrency.

### name

Encryption module

### spec

TPM 2.0 / RSA / ECC

### text

Your post-trained models, RAG knowledge bases, business data, and application code deserve protection. A dedicated security module isolates private keys. Hardware-backed asymmetric key protection reduces the risk of key export and duplication, creating a device-level security boundary for your business assets.

### name

Network module

### spec

Internal switching / routing / unified API

### text

Access local AI through a familiar cloud-service interface. Internal switching, routing, and unified APIs connect the modules, reducing the changes needed for system expansion and maintenance.

### name

Power and thermal management

### spec

USB-C PD 3.1 / up to 140W / independent Z-shaped air duct

### text

Unified power delivery, startup sequencing, and a dedicated Z-shaped air duct support system operation, reducing the impact of frequent restarts, high loads, and dust buildup. Less downtime and on-site maintenance mean fewer interruptions to your work.

## engine

### title

Familiar ecosystem, less integration work

### text

Custom vLLM retains the Hugging Face model ecosystem and uses our kernels for inference. The dedicated C++ engine tailors weight loading, kernels, and the runtime to model architectures and hardware. Both paths support RMQ models and connect applications through services with interfaces such as the OpenAI-compatible API, reducing integration work.

### title

Longer contexts. More concurrent tasks.

### text

Paged caching and recurrent-state management retain context, while prefix caching reuses prior computation. The dedicated engine extends context capacity through memory and SSD storage tiers. Batched input processing and continuous batching reduce repeated weight reads, sharing inference resources across document analysis, multi-turn interaction, and concurrent requests.

### title

A system shaped by inference

### text

The motherboard and inference engine are designed together, organizing computation and data access around GPU compute, memory bandwidth, and caches. Merged projections, kernel fusion, and expert grouping reduce data movement. MTP serves single-request generation and batched decoding serves concurrent tasks, turning hardware resources into model execution efficiency.

### sapphireLead

Light catches the facets, revealing the sapphire against the dark chassis. An exterior bonding process joins the gemstone to the surface while preserving its sharp facets. Its hardness makes shaping and mirror polishing a challenge and reduces production yields. Fifty-six hours of carving and polishing find their expression in this moment of light.

### ttiTitle

Ahead of
the heat

### ttiText1

Inference keeps running, and so does cooling. Through TTO, TTI observes the thermal state in real time. A neural network model predicts power for the next 90 seconds, then projects the temperature at 15, 45 and 90 seconds. It looks beyond the temperature right now, and remembers how the heat built up. Before heat rises, airflow is already in place; as it settles, fan speed eases back on its own. Fewer swings, and it handles different environments and workloads with ease.

### ttiText2

The model is trained on real device operating data. Sudden workloads can't be foreseen, so the base curve, configured limits and an independent protection policy always stand behind it.
